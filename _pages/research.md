## Research Interest Areas
<img src="/images/experiment_theory.jpg" alt="Graph neural networks for materials" style="float:right; margin:0 0 1rem 1rem; max-width:400px;">
I develop and employ powerful computational techniques to tackle crucial materials challenges. I use a combination of quantum-mechanical (e.g. **DFT**), **machine-learning** and **experimental** approaches to investigate, design, and develop advanced materials across a range of technologies.

I am especially interested in **catalysis** (heterogeneous catalysis, photocatalysis) and **energy storage** (batteries). Core focus areas are outlined below; we are flexible to the skillsets and interests of those who join our team.

## Our Tools
Experiment ⇆ theory: spectral “fingerprints” to validate DFT/QM/MM and fine-tune MACE models.
### Quantum Mechanics
<img src="/images/QMMM.png" alt="Orbitals / electronic states" style="float:right; margin:0 0 1rem 1rem; max-width:400px;">
First-principles quantum-mechanical methods—**Density Functional Theory (DFT)** and **hybrid QM/MM**—allow us to predict materials behaviour and chemical processes. These methods are implemented in robust codes and run on high-performance computers (e.g., YOUNG, ARCHER2), enabling quantitative predictions of structures and energetics of the important reactions such as NH3-SCR, HER, OER and CO2 hydrogenation.

### Machine Learning (ML) / Artificial Intelligence (AI)
<img src="/images/TOC.png" alt="Graph neural networks for materials" style="float:right; margin:0 0 1rem 1rem; max-width:300px;">
Machine learning has become a transformative tool for materials research. I use **MACE ML models** that reproduce quantum-mechanical results, but at far greater speed and scale compared to DFT. Examples include:
- Model phase transitions **microporous and dense silica** across large crystal databases  
- Fine-tune **MACE models** for better accuracy inorganic materials (structures, properties, defects)

### Experimental Activities 
<img src="/images/Experiments.png" alt="Graph neural networks for materials" style="float:right; margin:0 0 1rem 1rem; max-width:400px;">
I design, synthesise, and probe catalysts/photocatalysts under realistic conditions—linking operando data to mechanism.
- Operando catalysis: DRIFTS, XANES/EXAFS, XRD + reaction kinetics.
- Photocatalysis: CdS/g-C₃N₄ nanohybrids; H₂ evolution & formic-acid dehydrogenation.
- Water splitting: materials design, synthesis, benchmarking, stability tests.
- Toolbox: TEM, XPS, UV-Vis, Raman; hydro/solvothermal & ion-exchange syntheses.

These efforts often involve collaboration (and friendly competition!) with partners across academia and industry.

## Our Challenges

### Energy Materials
<img src="/images/energy_materials.jpg" alt="Energy materials" style="float:right; margin:0 0 1rem 1rem; max-width:260px;">
I aim to contribute to a better society through advanced materials for **energy conversion** and **storage**—from ultrathin solar cells and efficient photocatalysts to high-capacity battery cathodes.

I frequently collaborate with experimental and theoretical groups who develop new theory and synthesise novel materials and build devices; they test our predictions and we help explain observations—high-impact team projects with lots of fun along the way.

### Defects
<img src="/images/defects.png" alt="Point defects in semiconductors" style="float:right; margin:0 0 1rem 1rem; max-width:260px;">
Defects are rare atomic “mistakes” with outsized macroscopic effects; they often **control performance** in semiconductors, solar cells, TCOs, thermoelectrics, (photo)electrocatalysts, quantum sensors, and LEDs. Because they are hard to probe experimentally, **computational studies** provide crucial, high-resolution insight.

**Selected examples**
- *Identifying split-vacancy defects with foundation models & electrostatics*, **JPhys Energy** (2025)  
- *Identifying ground-state structures of point defects in solids*, **npj Comput. Mater.** (2023)

### Disorder
<img src="/images/disorder.png" alt="Static & dynamic disorder" style="float:right; margin:0 0 1rem 1rem; max-width:260px;">
Real materials contain **surfaces, interfaces, disorder, and defects**—features that frequently limit device performance. We develop techniques to model these imperfections accurately, increasingly leveraging ML to capture complex structure–property relationships.

**Selected examples**
- *Cation disorder engineering yields AgBiS₂ nanocrystals…*, **Nature Photonics** (2022)  
- *Strong absorption and ultrafast localisation in NaBiS₂…*, **Nature Communications** (2022)  
- *Cation disorder dominates defect chemistry in LMNO spinels*, **J. Mater. Chem. A** (2023)  
- *Interplay of static and dynamic disorder in Sn₂SbS₂I₃*, **J. Am. Chem. Soc.** (2023)

## Methods & Software Development
We also create new approaches and software to address field-wide challenges. A simple idea can have wide impact—e.g., **ShakeNBreak**, a strategy to find low-energy defect configurations that govern conductivity, solar performance, quantum sensing, and more.

**Selected tools**
- **ShakeNBreak** — Navigating the defect configurational landscape, **JOSS** (2022)  
- **doped** — Robust charged-defect supercell workflows, **JOSS** (2024)  
- **easyunfold** — Unfolding electronic band structures, **JOSS** (2024)
