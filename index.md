## What We Do

I use state-of-the-art computation (DFT/ML) to design next-generation energy materials for catalysis and understand their atomic-scale properties in the Department of Chemistry at the University College London, using state-of-the-art computational methods to design and develop next-generation materials for targeting catalytic applications such as NH3-SCR, HER, CO2 capturing and conversion.

I work at the intersection of computational materials science, experimental chemistry, and artificial intelligence (AI); deploying techniques from quantum chemistry (e.g. DFT), solid-state physics and machine learning (ML) to understand the atomic-level properties of materials. Using our insights from these calculations, run on massive high-performance computers, I predict, design and optimise the performance of materials in real-world technologies.
