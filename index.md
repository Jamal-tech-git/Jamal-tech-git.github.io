## What I Do
<!-- Simple hero banner that does not depend on theme header logic -->
<div style="position:relative;height:280px;border-radius:12px;overflow:hidden;margin-bottom:1.5rem;">
  <div style="position:absolute;inset:0;background:url('/images/experiment_theory.jpg') center/cover no-repeat;filter:brightness(0.85);"></div>
  <div style="position:relative;z-index:1;display:flex;height:100%;align-items:center;justify-content:center;">
    <h1 style="color:white;text-shadow:0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,.35);font-size:clamp(24px,4vw,40px);margin:0;padding:0 1rem;text-align:center;">

I utilise state-of-the-art computational methods, including quantum mechanics (DFT/Post-HF), machine learning (ML/AI) tools, and experimental techniques (from synthesis to analysis and testing), to design next-generation energy materials for catalysis and understand their atomic-scale properties. These methods enable the design and development of materials for catalytic applications, including **NH₃-SCR**, **HER**, and **CO₂ chemistry**, as well as **Materials properties**.

I work at the intersection of computational materials science, experimental chemistry, and artificial intelligence (AI), deploying techniques from quantum chemistry (e.g., DFT), solid-state physics, and machine learning (ML) to reveal atomic-level structure–property relationships. Using insights from large-scale calculations on HPC systems, I predict, design, and optimise materials for real-world technologies.


The research is led by **Jamal Abdul Nasir**.
